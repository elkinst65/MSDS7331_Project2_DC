You should use appropriate cross validation for all of your analysis (explain your chosen method of performance validation <i>in detail</i>). Try to use as much testing data as possible <i>in a realistic manner</i> (you should define what you think is realistic and why).</p>\n",

    "The data set chosen for lab 1 is the 2015 Washington DC Metro Crime inspired from a Kaggle data set found at https://www.kaggle.com/vinchinzu/dc-metro-crime-data. The data set was obtained by following the steps found on the [Using the Crime Map Application](http://mpdc.dc.gov/node/200622) page. This site allowed us to download data by political ward for all eight wards from 01/01/2015 to 12/31/2015 as CSV files. These individual ward files were then merged together into a single file for our use. This data set contains 36,493 entries and 18 attributes that are both continuous and discrete. This satisfies the data set requirement for a minimum of 30,000 entries and 10 attributes which are both continuous and discrete. Further definition of this data set will be discussed in the [Data Understanding](#data_understanding) section.\n",

The data is shared with its residents such as Advisory Neighborhood Commissions to help the police determine how to keep neighborhoods safe. The data is also analyzed to determine the effectiveness of current investments such as putting more officers on the streets, buying police more tools, and launching community partnerships, see [Washington DC Metro Police Department report](http://mpdc.dc.gov/publication/mpd-annual-report-2015) for more details.\n",
